Welcome to my Netflix homepage clone project! This project is a demonstration of my front-end development skills and is not affiliated with Netflix in any way.

## Description

This repository contains a simplified and static replica of Netflix's homepage. It was built using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript for interactivity. The goal was to mimic the design and layout of the Netflix homepage as closely as possible.

## Features

- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Hover effects and interactive elements for an engaging user experience.
- Static data for showcasing the content layout.
